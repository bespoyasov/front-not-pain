> Read [in Russian](../README.md).

## About Project

Frontend development can be difficult.

Designers ask to move the logo one pixel left-right, 100500 times they redo the page designs, backend developers break the API, testers throw the task back into development, managers set hell of a deadline.

Sad frontend developers try to fight it, but give up and drown in the routine.

This handbook will help them handle tasks faster and better, learn how to cut through the routine and enjoy the work.

Read it, share, and suggest ideas and improvements! Let's make our job easier :–)
